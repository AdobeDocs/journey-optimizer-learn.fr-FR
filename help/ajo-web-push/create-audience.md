# Créer une audience

To create an audience for the campaign, define a segment in Adobe Experience Platform that targets users eligible to receive push notifications. In this tutorial, users who have an active push subscription (Push Token exists), have not opted out of notifications (Denylist Flag is false), and are associated with the specified application configuration (Application Identifier equals `my-first-push`). These users are fully eligible to receive web push notifications through campaigns or journeys in Adobe Journey Optimizer.After creating the audience, make sure it has been evaluated so that profiles are populated and ready for targeting.
This audience is then used in the campaign to deliver scheduled web push messages only to subscribed users.
